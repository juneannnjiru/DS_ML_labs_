##DATA STRUCTURES PART 2: Operators, Bitwise Logic, and String Methods##

#Overview
In this lab, concepts introduced included calculation operatorations like addition, subtraction and various forms of division. We also looked at string operations and bitwise operaations, using the function bin() to convert numbers to their binary equivalent. We also looked at string operations and how to check if a string ends with specific characters.

#Objective
Understand different python operations for numbers and strings. And how logical comparisons works. Explore bitwise operations at binary level. 

#Tools
Python
Google Colab
Jupyter Notebook
Vs Code

#Step-by-step Learning
Mathematical calculation - Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Floor division (//), Modulo (%), Exponentiation (**)

Comparison Operations - Greater than (>), Less than (<), Equal to (==), Not equal to (!=), Greater than or equal to (>=), Less than or equal to (<=)

Membership Operators- check if values exist in a chosen component or sequence - in, not in

Identity Operators - Compares memory locations to see if they are the same - is, is not

Logical Operators - and, or, not

Assignment Operators - Modify the value of a variable
  Addition assignment (+=)
  Subtraction assignment (-=)
  Multiplication assignment (*=)
  Division assignment (/=)
  Floor division assignment (//=)
  Exponentiation assignment (**=)

Bitwise Operators -  Work at Base Level
  AND (&)
  OR (|)
  XOR (^)
  NOT (~)
  Right shift (>>)
  Left shift (<<)

String methods
  Converting case using upper() and lower()
  Checking character types using isalpha(), isdigit(), islower(), and isupper()
  Splitting strings using split()
  Joining strings using join()
  Replacing substrings using replace()
  Checking prefixes and suffixes using startswith() and endswith()

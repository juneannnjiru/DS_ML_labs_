# DATA STRUCTURES PART 1: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

## Overview
This lab introduced basic Python data structures and how they are used to organize and store data. Since data structures form the foundation of programming and data science, this session focused on understanding how lists, tuples, and dictionaries work and when to use them.

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to:
Understand how data can be stored in Python, learn the differences between lists, tuples, and dictionaries and practice using built-in methods to manipulate data. It also helped to build my confidence working in a Python environment and a different IDE other than VS Code.

## Tools Used
- Python 3  
- Google Colab  
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
- 
## Step-by-Step Learning Process
### Lists
Lists are ordered collections of items. They are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation.
During the session, I practiced:
- Creating lists using square brackets.
- Adding elements using `append()` and `extend()`.
- Inserting elements at specific positions using `insert()`.
- Removing elements using `remove()` and `pop()`.
- Finding positions using `index()`.
- Counting occurrences using `count()`.
- Sorting and reversing lists using `sort()` and `reverse()`.

This helped me understand how flexible lists are when working with changing data.

### Tuples
Tuples are also ordered collections, but unlike lists, they are immutable. Once created, their values cannot be changed.
In this section, I learned:
- How to create tuples using parentheses.
- That tuples are useful when data should not be modified.
- How to use `index()` and `count()` with tuples.

This helped me understand the difference between mutable and immutable data structures.

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs and are useful for structured information.
During this part of the lab, I practiced:
- Creating dictionaries using curly brackets.
- Retrieving values using keys.
- Viewing keys and values using `keys()` and `values()`.
- Viewing key-value pairs using `items()`.
- Updating dictionaries using `update()`.
- Removing entries using dictionary methods.


## Lessons Learned
- Lists are flexible and can be modified easily.
- Tuples are useful when data should remain constant.
- Dictionaries are effective for organizing structured data.
- Small syntax mistakes can cause errors, so attention to detail is important.
- Understanding data structures is essential before moving to advanced topics like data analysis or machine learning.
